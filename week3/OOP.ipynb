Just we need to make changes for the methods and it will not affect the functionality.\n",

Example – A car is an object that has property color, model, brand name, fuel type, etc, and behaviors like, it runs. So these properties and behavior make an object (CAR).\n",
    "\n",
    "-classes – A class can be stated as the BLUEPRINT of the object. This states what an object can do. It contains all the features, attributes, and behavior of what the model can do. We can say that class contains the definition of the object. Example – Car color, engine type, etc. And with the definition, we can create any number of  objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "-methods – Methods are the ATTRIBUTES of the class which are defined for the specified behavior of the object. It can also modify the state of the class. Example – Method to drive a car, It changes the state of the car from parking state to running state.\n",
